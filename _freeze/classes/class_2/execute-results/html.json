Humans have begun to set conservation of the Biodiversity on Earth as a moral and social good. (Holmes Rolston III, 2012)\n\n- Conservation biology origins were driven by studies and discoveries in basic sciences such as genetics and population dynamics, but soon became manifest in applied sciences like forestry, fisheries, wildlife management, and more.\n\n- The extinction crisis created an urgency to develop an alternative concept to that of endangered species. That concept was biodiversity! [@VanDyke2020]\n\n---\n\n## Why should we care about Biodiversity?\n\n- A more diverse combination of species (biological community)..\n    - ... produces a more productive environment\n    - ... produces a more resistant environment\n    - ... produces a more resilient environment\n    - ... produces more stable ecosystem processes\n    \n- The ESA (Ecological Society of America) concluded that maintaining biodiversity is a safeguard against risk resulting from changes in environmental conditions because it extends the productive use of a site's resources over time and provides an effective way to provide multiple goods and services. [@Hooper2005]\n\n> Biodiversity is essential for food security and nutrition and offers key options for sustainable livelihoods (Convention on Biological Diversity,  [https://www.cbd.int](https://www.cbd.int)). \n\n---\n\n![Multifunctional ecosystem require many species.

None of them is immune to drawbacks!\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n> Our results show a marked difference, with surveys based on a phylogenetic species concept showing more species (48%) and an associated decrease in population size and range. We discuss the serious consequences of this trend for conservation, including an apparent change in the number of endangered species, potential political fallout, and the difficulty of deciding what should be conserved. [@Agapow2004]\n\n- The concept of Evolutionary Significant Units (ESU) aims at preserving both evolutionary potential and organisms. ESUs are based on criteria that are associated to genetic variation between and within populations [@Moritz1994].\n\n- Management Units (MU)\n\n---\n\n![[*Cyclura* diversity in the West Indies]{style=\"text-align: center;\"}](../figures/class_2_3_cycluradiv.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n---\n \n## Alpha diversity\n\n- The diversity of species within an ecological community\n\n### Species richness and Evennes\n\n- The number of species present on each site\n- Shannon Index \n\n$$\nH = - \\sum_i \\ p_i \\ ln(p_i), \\ \\ (i=1, 2, 3,...,s), \\ \\ (0 \\le H^{'}\\le \\infty)\n$$\n\n### Beta diversity\n\n- Whittaker\n\n$$\nS/\\alpha-1\n$$\n\n### Gamma diversity\n\n$$\ndS/dD[(g+l)/2]\n$$\n\n# Widespread distribution VS restricted distribution\n\n# Biodiversity distribution\n\nPlants and vertebrates show an increase in the number of species from temperate to tropical latitudes [@Reid1989; @Huston1994].\n\n---\n\n\n# References\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
