By discussing the genetic basis of adaptation, the relationship between population size and evolutionary potential, and population biology, the student develops autonomy in the process of understanding of different approaches and methods, consolidating the awareness that conservation biology is a crisis discipline that requires specific analytical skills to guide appropriate interventions.\nStudents will develop professional language and communication skills through a continuous interaction with the teacher and interventions during classes. Additionally, students are guided in the understanding of the discipline through the access to primary literature in English. The process of development such skills is monitored by written periodical checks, with open questions."

Modern china forgo this view.\n\n\n\nThese are all historical examples showing that the notion to conserve our natural resources is well known and established in our species.
