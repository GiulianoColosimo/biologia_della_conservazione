Additionally, students are guided in the understanding of the discipline also by accessing to primary literature in English. The process of development such skills is monitored by written periodical checks, with open questions.\nThe guided reading to the primary literature and the open discussion during class promote student’s ability to update and deepen his/her knowledge autonomously, through a better research and evaluation of sources. The transversal thinking helps students to seek and establish interdisciplinary links and develop a broad vision."
